Hi! This a project during my bootcamp with **Le Reacteur**.
We had to create a react website with a custom API provided by Le Reacteur.

## Frontend

Using React, Axios & Vite. You can find the website here :
➡️ **https://marvel-test-tech.netlify.app/**

## Backend

Using Express.js, Mondb Atlas. Deployed on Northflank.
You can find the link to the backend on github here :

## Errors currently being fix ⛔️

Trying to fix on mozilla the background video that is not displayed..

➡️ For better experience use google chrome. Thanks.
